                New Life Covenant Church is a Pentecostal, Charismatic and Evangelical church with a dominant gift and anointing of Revelation Knowledge. We have and believe in fundamental doctrines that constitute our spiritual DNA and define us as well as distinguish us as a ministry with a God given mandate and purpose. These are our Non-Negotiables. Essentially they are at the centre of everything we do, unite us as a ministry
